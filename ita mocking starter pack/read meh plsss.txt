mockingDemo project will be used as base project for this upcoming Mockito course's demo and activity (and homework too! haha sorry)

it is a gradle project but you may add this project to your current workspace
(just take Cook.java and Waiter.java) if it will be faster/easier for you.  
remember to import dependencies to your pom.xml/build.gradle if not yet available.

i hope may matutunan kayo sakin lol
